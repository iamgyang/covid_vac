This is the replication file for the paper, "Covid-19 Vaccine Development and Rollout in Historical Perspective" by Amanda Glassman, Charles Kenny and George Yang

The _full_ replication file (with the data) can be found on the CGD website; this github repo just contains the code, as the data itself is very large and not amenable to hosting on github.

Please email gzyang4@gmail.com or ckenny@cgdev.org for any questions.
